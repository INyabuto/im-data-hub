# Impact Malaria Data Specification {#data}

## Introduction 

IM data is specified through the use indicators. Indicators consist of a numerator, denominator, and a count. The numerator and denominator are data elements, and the count specifies the applied operation. Counts can be a percentage, a number, or a ratio. 

In this chapter, we are going to explore the IM indicators and how they are constructed in the Data Hub. 

We’ll start by a short introduction to data elements and how they form the base/source of the IM indicators. We’ll then explore the different counts and wind up by showing you all the IM indicators.
