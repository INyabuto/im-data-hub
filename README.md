## Background

Impact Maria (IM) Data Hub is a web-based project monitoring system used to collect, analyze, and report indicator data for Impact Malaria Project. IM is a five-year project by the US President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) global service to reduce malaria mortality and morbidity.

The BAO system implements it in an ST-3 plan that began on Nov 27th, 2018. 

The system hosts all the IM data. Multiple partners use it at different levels from donors (PMI), implementers (PSI, Jhpiego, UCSF,.e.tc), and government ministries of health (MOH) to track project progress and country performance.

It’s active in 11 countries, and collects a tremendous amount of data on;
