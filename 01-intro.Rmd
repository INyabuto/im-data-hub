## Background

Impact Maria (IM) Data Hub is a web-based project monitoring system used to collect, analyze, and report IM indicator data. IM is a five-year project by the US President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) global service to reduce malaria mortality and morbidity.

The BAO system implements it in an ST-3 plan that began on Nov 27th, 2018. 

The system hosts all the IM data. Multiple partners use it at different levels from donors (PMI), implementers (PSI, Jhpiego, UCSF,.e.tc), and government ministries of health (MOH) to track project progress and country performance.

It’s active in 11 countries, and collects a tremendous amount of data on; 

1.  Case Management
2.  Malaria in pregnancy 
3.  Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention
4.  Global Technical Leadership.

IM Data Hub is compatible with HNQIS version 4. 

### Purpose

1. To monitor IM indicator data.
2. Provide access to IM indicator data at the country and global level.
3. Enable central/global level data management 
4. Track project progress and country performance 
5. Promote data use for decision making.
