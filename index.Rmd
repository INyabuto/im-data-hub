This is a technical guide for the IM Data Hub, __a work currently in progress by BAO systems intended for official release in [production](imdatahub.org) by ______ 2020


[__IM Data Hub__](imdatahub.org) is a warehouse for Impact Malaria indicator data. It houses all the IM indicator data for project monitoring and use. It is primarily designed with data users in mind, and so it comes with several tools specifically designed to enable monitoring and promote the use of IM data.

Today, IM Data Hub is extensively used in 11 countries in Africa, and it collects a tremendous amount of data in the following tracks; 


1. case management
2. Malaria in Pregnancy
3. Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention
4. Global Technical Leadership.

It is used by multiple partners at different levels, from donors (PMI), Implementers (PSI, Jhpiego, UCSF, e.t.c), and government ministries of health in tracking country performance.

IM Data Hub is implemented in an ST-3 plan since Nov 27th, 2018, and it supports HNQIS (1.4) compatibility. 

This guide provides information and the technical specifications you need to know about Impact Malaria (IM) Data Hub. Itâ€™s an all-inclusive guide and it complements other materials on the development, testing, or training in the Data Hub.

<!--  Start of the preface -->

# Preface {-} 
## What is IM Data Hub? 
Impact Maria (IM) Data Hub is a project monitoring system used to collect, analyze, and report Impact Malaria indicator data. IM Data Hub is where all the IM data lives.


It's built on DHIS2 core software, and it supports HNQIS (1.4) compatibility. 


## Who should read this guide?

This guide is aimed at two main audiences. 

- System Administrators who are involved in the administration or the daily operation of IM Data Hub.
- Project teams & M&E staff interested to learn more about the IM Data Hub. You will find this helpful in understanding the overall system set up and how different components work together in the system.

## What is covered in this guide.

The guide is divided into seven chapters.

1. Introduction - offers some background information, basic setup, and how to get started on IM Data Hub quickly.
2. Understanding IM Data Hub Components - explores the basic set up to provide an understanding of the different components and how they function.
3. Data Specification - `builds on the understanding of IM Data Hub components and talks about the IM indicators and data reporting.
4. Metadata Specifications - dives into the data specification and the system components and talks about what lies at the bottom, the metadata. 
5. Security and Access Model - Explains the security mechanisms and access model.
6. Customization & Troubleshooting - Guides the customization, troubleshooting, and how to get help on IM Data Hub. 
7. Appendix -


## What is not covered in this guide.

The focus of this guide is to walk you through the technical specification of the IM Data Hub. We attempt to showcase some best practices in configuring, testing, troubleshooting, reporting, monitoring, or use of data in the IM Data Hub. However, still, you need other references to master these essential skill sets.
