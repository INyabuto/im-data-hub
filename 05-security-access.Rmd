# Security Mechanism & Access Model {#access}

## Introduction 

Security mechanisms are technical tools or techniques used to implement security services. They define how the system is accessed, by whom, and provides an audit record of all the activities that have taken place. 

Access model, on the other hand, defines how objects are accessed or shared in the system.

In this chapter, we discuss the security mechanism and access model applied in the IM Data Hub. 

## Security Mechanism  

There are two main security mechanisms implemented in the IM Data Hub.

1. Authentication: a mechanism that restricts access to only authorized users or clients in the data hub.
2. Audit trail: a mechanism that detects whether there was an attempt, unexpected, or any unauthorized activity has taken place. 


In this section, we discuss the authentication mechanisms and where to find the audit trail. 

### Authentication Mechanisms

IM Data Hub supports two types of authentication:

1. Basic Authentication. A mechanism that allows users to login or send their credentials over an HTTP web server. 
2. OAuth 2. A mechanism that allows third party clients or apps to connect on behalf of a user via reusable tokens. Oauth2 access is based on IM Data Hub user roles. Weâ€™ll discuss user roles in section X.


#### Basic Authentication 

Users can login IM Data Hub by specifying their `username` and `password` on the login page. 

Technically, the username is appended with a colon and the password is encoded through `base64encode` and then sent over to the server. 

`base64encode(username:password)`

IM Data Hub also provides two factor authentication mechanisms which allows the users to receive a `2FA code` for confirmation at the time of login.  You can enable the two factor authentication is enabled on the user settings app. You can read more about the 2FA mechanism.

#### OAuth 2 Authentication

Third-party apps can connect to IM Data Hub via tokens provided by the OAuth 2 authentication mechanism. IM data Hub does not support the fine-grained OAuth 2 roles, but rather it provides access based on the user roles. 

Setting up OAuth 2 authentication requires access to the 'IM Data Hub Web API`.  You can find the specification about this in the developer's guide. 


## Access Model 

Access Model defines what and how objects are shared or accessed in the IM Data Hub. Objects, in this case, refers to the data, metadata, and all the components in the data hub. 

There are two ways of setting up the access model.

User roles: Setting roles and the access level for the objects in the data hub.
User groups: Defining groups to sharing access to objects in the data hub.


### User roles

User roles defines the level of access to different objects in the data hub. You can set and assign roles to different objects in from the user app.  

The following are the user roles currently set up the data hub: 

Name  | Details
------ |:--------------
_Admin - Country User Management | Administration of new users and user groups
_Admin - Import / Export MetaData |Import and export of metadata and data
_Admin - Org Unit admin advanced | Edit OU levels
_Admin - Org Units (Basic) | Create, edit, and delete OUs
_Admin - User Management advanced | Clone and disable users
_Analytics - Services (all) | Full access to all of DHIS2 analytical tools
_App - Browser cache cleaner | Clear DHIS2 browser cache
_User - Data Entry Aggregated | Data entry for data sets (Data Entry, Data Capture for DHIS2)
_User - Data Entry Tracker | Data entry for programs (Event capture, DHIS2 Android Capture)
