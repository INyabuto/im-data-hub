["comp.html", "Chapter 2 Understanding IM Data Hub 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Reporting Component 2.3 Data Mining Component", " Chapter 2 Understanding IM Data Hub 2.1 Introduction Now that you’re already started and you’ve got some essential background about IM Data Hub, we are going to explore the details/components that form IM Data Hub. As we saw in chapter 1, IM Data Hub is not just a database; it’s a project monitoring system. It’s divided into components; whose primary goal is to monitor IM indicator data for action. We’ll dive deeper into the components and understand how they are set up in the Hub. Understanding IM Data Hub components will allow you to report, analyse, and monitor IM indicators more effectively. I’ll start by showing the you reporting component, IM Data Hub uses data sets to collect indicator data. We will discuss them briefly in the next section. We will then walk through the data mining piece, and how the different outputs are pulled together on a dashboard for the project use. We’ll wind up by exploring the data quality component and how the IM indicator data pass through the quality checks. 2.2 Reporting Component Reporting is organized through the use of data sets. A data set is simply a list of data elements that are grouped for data collection. We’ll talk more about data elements in the next chapter. A data set has a reporting period and an organization unit. The reporting period specifies how the data is reported, i.e., monthly, or quarterly, while the organization unit determines the location “where” the information is collected. IM Data Hub has two main types of data sets; Global data sets for reporting IM indicators. You will learn more about this in section 2.2.1 Country specific data set for reporting PMP indicators. You will learn more about this in section 2.2.2 The data sets are accessible through the data entry app (Fig. 2.1), and they appear as forms. They are designed to mimic the paper forms to allow ease of data entry/reporting process. Figure 2.1: An icon of the data entry app 2.2.1 Global datasets Global datasets are accessible at a global level and are used to report IM indicators on a monthly and quarterly basis. They consist of five data sets, which all begin with the [project code] followed by the [data set name] as shown below in yellow (Fig 2.2) Figure 2.2: Global datasets Global datasets are divided into sections (in grey) that groups IM data elements into multiple subheadings for ease of data collection. There are five main sections: Diagnosis Treatment MIP Technical leadership Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention We will talk about them in chapter 4. 2.2.1.1 Accessing Global Datasets If you haven’t already logged in yet, please log in now at: IM Data Hub demo Username :demoUser and Password : Temp1234! Search for the Data Entry App from Apps Click on the test world on top left if not already selected Select IM Case Reporting data set and the period to report; this case October 2019. Wait for the data entry form to load, and check that you can see the same screen as in Fig 2.3 below. Congratulations! You can now start reporting. Figure 2.3: IM Case Reporting Data Entry Form Before completing the records, please notice the Run validation button at the top right. We will talk about this in section 6. The complete button submits the records into the data hub. 2.2.2 Country Specific Datasets Country specific datasets are mainly used to report country’s performance management plan (PMP) indicators. They are accessible at the district or facility level and are reported monthly. Similar to the global data sets, Country specific ones are organized in sections (in grey) with multiple subheadings. Fig 2.4 Figure 2.4: Country Specific Datasets 2.2.2.1 Accessing Country Specific Datasets Follow the same steps in section 2.2.1.1 to launch the data entry app. Ensure you are loogied in with your country demo account. Click on the level to report (i.e country / district / facility) on the left bar Select [Country ISO] Case Reporting data set and the period to report; this case October 2019. Wait for the form to load. Congratulations! For some countries like Kenya, Ghana and Mali the reporting process is automated through scripts. This is discussed in section. 2.3 Data Mining Component Once the data is collected or loaded into the Data Hub, it then becomes available for data mining. Data mining is a technical process that involves the extraction and analysis of data to generate information. The data mining component provides tools for enabling the extraction and analysis of IM indicator data. Pivot Tables - extracts data in a tabular format and enables the ability to pivot IM indicators. Data Visualizers - generates a variety of charts; standard line, bar charts, pie charts e.t.c Maps - gives the ability to visualize IM data on a map. We will discuss more of these tools in section 2.3.1, section ?? and section ?? 2.3.1 Pivot Tables If you are familiar with excel, you are probably aware of “pivoting” the ability to summarize data on table in multiple dimensions. Excel Pivot Tables inspire Pivot Table. Pivot Table offers quick access to IM data in a tabular format. It allows the ability to ‘pivot’ data in several dimensions, such as indicators, data elements, periods, and organization units. The aspects can quickly appear as rows or columns, depending on the tailored view. In the following subsection, we are going to access and tabulate a sample of IM indicator data using the Pivot Table. As an example, we tabulate and pivot IM Confirmed vs. Suspected Malaria Cases. for last 12 months at the global level (world) Please refresh your browser or login with the demo account below if you have not.

["data.html", "Chapter 3 Impact Malaria Data Specification 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Data Elements 3.3 Counts 3.4 Indicators", " Chapter 3 Impact Malaria Data Specification 3.1 Introduction IM data is specified through the use indicators. Indicators consist of a numerator, denominator, and a count. The numerator and denominator are data elements, and the count specifies the applied operation. Counts can be a percentage, a number, or a ratio. In this chapter, we are going to explore the IM indicators and how they are constructed in the Data Hub. We’ll start by a short introduction to data elements and how they form the base/source of the IM indicators. We’ll then explore the different counts and wind up by showing you all the IM indicators. 3.2 Data Elements Data elements form the base of IM indicators. As we mentioned in the previous chapter, they define how IM data are collected and stored in the Data Hub. IM Data hub consists of: Global data elements - are shared across a number of countries. Country specific data elements - used by specified country data sets. IM data elements are grouped by country and programs for easy access from the pivot table, data visualizer and maps app. The data elements have the following key fields; uid, name, shortName, and code for uniquely identifying the data element in the data hub. description to document more information about the data point. formName that appears on the data entry form. domainType that specifies the data model - aggregate or tracker. aggregationType defines how data is stored in the data hub. More about data elements can be found at. http://im-dev.psi-mis.org/api/schemas/dataElement.json For now please note the uid,name,shortName and formName we will discuss these in section 3.4.1 and section 3.4.2. 3.3 Counts Counts define the operation applied to IM indicators calculations. There are four main types of operations; 1 - Atomic (number) - absolute numbers 1 - Ratio - a fraction of the numerator and denominator 100 - percent - a ratio multiplied by 100 percent. 1000 - per thousand - a ratio multiplied by 1000 3.4 Indicators Remember that an indicator has a numerator, a denominator and a count. In this section, you will notice that similar to data elements, indicators also have the uid, short name and code to uniquely identifying them in the hub. IM Data Hub indicators are grtouped into two; Global IM indicators - computes PMP data for global access. Country Specific (PMP) indicators - computes PMP data for country access.

["meta.html", "Chapter 4 Metadata Specification 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Organization Units (OU) 4.3 Metadata 4.4 Core Metadata", " Chapter 4 Metadata Specification 4.1 Introduction In the previous chapter, we learned about the IM &amp; PMP indicators and how they are stored and constructed in the Data Hub. That is essential knowledge for you to start monitoring IM indicator data from the source to how they are presented in the IM Data Hub. In this chapter, we’ll dive deep to the bottom and explore what lies beneath the IM Data Hub, the metadata. Metadata is data about data. Let’s get started! First, I’d say anything in the data hub contains metadata. Metadata defines what, why, where, and how parts are set up in the data hub. They provide references to different objects in the data hub. Already you are familiar with datasets, data elements, or you might have heard of sections in the other chapters. All these are essentially metadata themselves. IM Data Hub Metadata are specified in either CSV, JSON or XML formats are available at the metadata API endpoint: https://im-dev.psi-mis.org/api/metadata Metadata has a name, uid, code that uniquely identifies the object in the hub. It also has a sharing setting that defines the access group. We’ll talk about the access group in the following chapter. All IM Data Hub metadata can be accessed individually by specifying their names or ids on the API endpoint. For example, the metadata for a data element with the short name suspected malaria cases is accessed at: https://im-dev.psi-mis.org/api/29/dataElements/eHWYhy8vO8q.json In the following sections we discuss IM Data Hub metadata in three main groups; Organization Unit stores information about the location where IM indicator data is reported, analyzed, or presented. Metadata that specifies what, why, and how IM Data Hub components are set up. They include; datasets, data elements, sections, data elements groups &amp; group sets, organization unit groups &amp; group sets, indicators, indicator groups, categories, categories, combo, &amp; combinations. e.t.c Core Metadata - any metadata that is shared publicly for re-usability across the data hub. 4.2 Organization Units (OU) Organization Units specifies the location or where IM indicators are collected, analyzed, or presented on a dashboard. There are two main types of OUs in the data hub. Test - a list of OUs for development and testing objects in the data hub. This is where we have been doing our practices. World - a list of OUs for production or real use in the data hub. The main master list is accessible here They are structured in the form of a tree or through a hierarchy to allow entries, data processing, and drill downs/ups on the dashboard. They also define access levels in the data hub. We’ll discuss access levels in chapter 5. IM Data Hub OUs are grouped into OU groups and group sets for disaggregation of IM indicators data. We discuss the groups in section @ref{ougroup} 4.2.1 OU Trees As we mentioned above, IM Data Hub OUs are organized in a tree-like structure that provides different levels for reporting, data processing, and presentation of IM data; in this section, we describe the OU structure by country (Fig X). The structure is in the form hierarchy and begins with the country to subnational level 4. Country Subnational level 1 Subnational level 2 Subnational level 3 Subnational level 4 Cameroon Region District Aire de santé Facility Cote d’Ivoire Region District Facility / DRC Province Zone de santé Aire de santé Facility Kenya County Sub-county Ward Facility Ghana Region District Sub-district Facility Mali Region District Aire de santé Facility Niger Sierra Leone Province District Chiefdom Facility Zambia Province District Facility / The following is the Metadata endpoint for organization unit levels. https://im-dev.psi-mis.org/api/organisationUnitLevels.json Next we’ll talk about the OU groups and group sets. OU groups, OU group sets. IM Data Hub OUs consists of the following groups and group sets by countries and the type of facility. Table 4.1: A table showing OU groups and group set OU group set OU groups CM - Facility Type (OU Group set) CM CSI, CM Hopital, CM Unknown facility type, CM CMA CM - Ownership Type (OU Group set) CM Public ML - Facility Type (OU Group set) ML Hospital, ML CSCom, ML CSRef ML - Ownership Type (OU Group set) ML Public NE - Facility type NE CSI, NE Hopital NE - Ownership type NE Public 4.3 Metadata IM Data Hub implements the following Metadata types. Table 4.2: A table showing metadata types implimented in the IM Data Hub Metadata Description Data elements Description Data elements forms the basis of the IM Data Hub. They define what is recorded in the system.IM Data Hub data elements follows PSI DHIS2 standards for names and short names &amp; the IM Indicator matrix for the form names. For instance: IM CR - DX Suspected malaria cases is a data element that records suspected malaria cases Date element groups Description Data element groups provides a mechanism for classifying IM Data Hub data elements into a common theme. For instance: CD Supportive Supervision groups together all IM supportive supervision data elements. recorded in Congo Data sets Description Data reporting in the IM Data Hub is organized through the use of the use of data sets. A data set is a collection of data elements grouped together for data collection. For instance: IM Case Reporting is a data set used to report case reporting data globally Sections Description Section are used to split the IM Data Hub data sets into small reportable chunks known as modules. They allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using the tabular forms in DHIS2 and are quick and simple to design. For instance: Diagnosis, Treatment, MIP and Reporting are section within the IM Case Reporting data set Category combos Description Category combos are used to apply IM disaggregation onto the data elements and indicators.They allow multiple categories to be combined into a related set. For instance: IM PMP DX 1 - Percentage of confirmed malaria cases (NP) is disaggregated according to the following categories; CORE - Sex | CORE - Parasitological test | CORE - Age-group Periods Description IM Data Hub supports DHIS2 standard period types to report and analyze performance over time. For instance: 201901 to report on January of 2019 Indicator Description Indicators allows the computation of IM data. They consist of a numerator, a denominator and a data element Indicator groups Description Similar to data elements groups, indicator groups - groups together IM indicator to allow easy access from the analytical tools For instance: KE PMP is an indicator group with all PMP indicators for Kenya 4.4 Core Metadata The following is a list of all IM data hub core metadata.

["access.html", "Chapter 5 Security Mechanism &amp; Access Model 5.1 Introduction 5.2 Security Mechanism 5.3 Access Model", " Chapter 5 Security Mechanism &amp; Access Model 5.1 Introduction Security mechanisms are technical tools or techniques used to implement security services. They define how the system is accessed, by whom, and provides an audit record of all the activities that have taken place. Access model, on the other hand, defines how objects are accessed or shared in the system. In this chapter, we discuss the security mechanism and access model applied in the IM Data Hub. 5.2 Security Mechanism There are two main security mechanisms implemented in the IM Data Hub. Authentication: a mechanism that restricts access to only authorized users or clients in the data hub. Audit trail: a mechanism that detects whether there was an attempt, unexpected, or any unauthorized activity has taken place. In this section, we discuss the authentication mechanisms and where to find the audit trail. 5.2.1 Authentication Mechanisms IM Data Hub supports two types of authentication: Basic Authentication. A mechanism that allows users to login or send their credentials over an HTTP web server. OAuth 2. A mechanism that allows third party clients or apps to connect on behalf of a user via reusable tokens. Oauth2 access is based on IM Data Hub user roles. We’ll discuss user roles in section X. 5.2.1.1 Basic Authentication Users can login IM Data Hub by specifying their username and password on the login page. Technically, the username is appended with a colon and the password is encoded through base64encode and then sent over to the server. base64encode(username:password) IM Data Hub also provides two factor authentication mechanisms which allows the users to receive a 2FA code for confirmation at the time of login. You can enable the two factor authentication is enabled on the user settings app. You can read more about the 2FA mechanism. https://www.google.com/landing/2step/ 5.2.1.2 OAuth 2 Authentication Third-party apps can connect to IM Data Hub via tokens provided by the OAuth 2 authentication mechanism. IM data Hub does not support the fine-grained OAuth 2 roles, but rather it provides access based on the user roles. Setting up OAuth 2 authentication requires access to the ’IM Data Hub Web API`. You can find the specification about this in the developer’s guide. 5.3 Access Model Access Model defines what and how objects are shared or accessed in the IM Data Hub. Objects, in this case, refers to the data, metadata, and all the components in the data hub. There are two ways of setting up the access model.
