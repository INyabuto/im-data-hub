["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Background 1.2 Getting Started", " Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Background Impact Maria (IM) Data Hub is a web-based project monitoring system used to collect, analyze, and report indicator data for Impact Malaria Project. IM is a five-year project by the US President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) global service to reduce malaria mortality and morbidity. The BAO system implements it in an ST-3 plan that began on Nov 27th, 2018. The system hosts all the IM data. Multiple partners use it at different levels from donors (PMI), implementers (PSI, Jhpiego, UCSF,.e.tc), and government ministries of health (MOH) to track project progress and country performance. It’s active in 11 countries, and collects a tremendous amount of data on; Case Management Malaria in pregnancy Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention Global Technical Leadership. IM Data Hub is compatible with HNQIS version 4. 1.1.1 Purpose IM Data Hub was developed; To monitor IM indicator data. Provide access to IM indicator data at the country and global level. Enable central/global level data management Track project progress and country performance Promote data use for decision making. 1.1.2 Servers IM Data Hub is available at the following instances; Development instance: Where all the developments and testing takes place. It’s accessible at https://im-dev.psi-mis.org/ (version 2.30 as of Jan 9, 2019): Analytics run at midnight and 12:00 UTC (EAT -3h) Production instance: Ready for use. Accessible at impactmalaria-mis.org (Version 2.30, not ready as of Aug 30, 2019): 1.2 Getting Started The easiest way to get started to IM Data Hub is to log in at the test server at https://im-dev.psi-mis.org/ with the following credentials.

["understanding-im-data-hub.html", "Chapter 2 Understanding IM Data Hub 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Reporting Component", " Chapter 2 Understanding IM Data Hub 2.1 Introduction Now that you’re already started and you’ve got some essential background about IM Data Hub, we are going to explore the details/components that form IM Data Hub. As we saw in the previous chapter, IM Data Hub is not just a database; it’s a project monitoring system. It’s divided into components; whose primary goal is to monitor IM indicator data for action. We’ll dive deeper into the components and understand how they are set up in the Hub. Understanding IM Data Hub components will allow you to report, analyse, and monitor IM indicators more effectively. I’ll start by showing the you reporting component, IM Data Hub uses data sets to collect indicator data. We will discuss them briefly in the next section. We will then walk through the data mining piece, and how the different outputs are pulled together on a dashboard for the project use. We’ll wind up by exploring the data quality component and how the IM indicator data pass through the quality checks. 2.2 Reporting Component Reporting is organized through the use of data sets. A data set is simply a list of data elements that are grouped for data collection. We’ll talk more about data elements in the next chapter. A data set has a reporting period and an organization unit. The reporting period specifies how the data is reported, i.e., monthly, or quarterly, while the organization unit determines the location “where” the information is collected. IM Data Hub has two main types of data sets; Global data sets for reporting IM indicators. You will learn more about this in section 2.3 Country specific data set for reporting PMP indicators. You will learn more about this in section 2.4 The data sets are accessible through the data entry app, and they appear as forms. They are designed to mimic the paper forms to allow ease of data entry/reporting process. 2.2.1 Global datasets Global datasets are accessible at a global level and are used to report IM indicators on a monthly and quarterly basis. They consist of five data sets, which all begin with the [project code] followed by the [data set name] as shown below in yellow. (Fig 2) Global datasets are divided into sections (in grey) that groups IM data elements into multiple subheadings for ease of data collection. There are five main sections: Diagnosis Treatment MIP Technical leadership Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention We will talk about them in chapter 4. 2.2.1.1 Accessing Global Datasets. If you haven’t already logged in yet, please log in now at: IM Data Hub demo Username :demoUser and Password : Temp1234! Search for the Data Entry App from Apps Click on the test world on top left if not already selected Select IM Case Reporting data set and the period to report; this case October 2019. Wait for the data entry form to load, and check that you can see the same screen as in Fig. 5 below. Congratulations! You can now start reporting.. Before completing the records, please notice the Run validation button at the top right. We will talk about this in section 6. The complete button submits the records into the data hub. 2.2.2 Country Specific Datasets "],
["impact-malaria-data-specification.html", "Chapter 3 Impact Malaria Data Specification 3.1 Introduction", " Chapter 3 Impact Malaria Data Specification 3.1 Introduction IM data is specified through the use indicators. Indicators consist of a numerator, denominator, and a count. The numerator and denominator are data elements, and the count specifies the applied operation. Counts can be a percentage, a number, or a ratio. In this chapter, we are going to explore the IM indicators and how they are constructed in the Data Hub. We’ll start by a short introduction to data elements and how they form the base/source of the IM indicators. We’ll then explore the different counts and wind up by showing you all the IM indicators.

["metadata-specification.html", "Chapter 4 Metadata Specification 4.1 Introduction", " Chapter 4 Metadata Specification 4.1 Introduction In the previous chapters, we learned about the IM &amp; PMP indicators and how they are stored and constructed in the Data Hub. That is essential knowledge for you to start monitoring IM indicator data from the source to how they are presented in the IM Data Hub. In this chapter, we’ll dive deep to the bottom and explore what lies underneath beneath the IM Data Hub, the metadata. Metadata is data about data. Interesting? Let’s get started! "],
