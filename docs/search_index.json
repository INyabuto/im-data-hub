["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Background 1.2 Getting Started", " Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Background The Impact Maria (IM) Data Hub is a web-based project monitoring system used to collect, analyze, monitor and report IM indicator data. IMPACT Malaria is a five year contract funded by the US President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) to work with national malaria programs to fight malaria and save lives by strengthening diagnosis, treatment, and drug-based prevention for those most at risk, particularly children and pregnant women. The IMPACT Malaria Data Hub is the IMPACT Malaria project monitoring system database for IM indicators. It is a web based database in a District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) instance and it houses all IM indicator data for project monitoring and use. It is primarily designed with data users in mind, and so its configuration comes with approaches specifically designed to enable monitoring and promote the use of IM data. The IM Data Hub is used in IM countries in Africa and Asia and it collects a tremendous amount of data in the following tracks: Case Management Malaria in pregnancy Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention Global Technical Leadership. It is used by multiple partners at different levels, from Ministries of Health (MoHs), National Malaria Control Programs (NMCPs), donors like the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), implementers (PSI, Jhpiego, University of California San Francisco (UCSF)) to track project monitoring and performance. 1.1.1 Purpose The IM Data Hub was developed: To monitor IM indicator data Provide access to IM indicator data at district, country and global level Enable central/global level data management Track project progress and country performance Promote data use for decision making 1.1.2 Servers The IM Data Hub has two istances: A development instance at dev.imdatahub.org hosted on a ST-3 plan from BAO Systems since Nov 22nd, 2018 for prototyping, testing and piloting.

["access.html", "Chapter 5 Security Mechanism &amp; Access Model 5.1 Introduction 5.2 Security Mechanism 5.3 Access Model 5.4 Important Best Practices for the Access Model", " Chapter 5 Security Mechanism &amp; Access Model 5.1 Introduction Security mechanisms are technical tools or techniques used to implement security services. They define how the system is accessed, by whom, and provides an audit record of all the activities that have taken place. Access model, on the other hand, defines how objects are accessed or shared in the system. In this chapter, we discuss the security mechanism and access model applied in the IM Data Hub. 5.2 Security Mechanism There are two main security mechanisms implemented in the IM Data Hub: Authentication: a mechanism that restricts access to only authorized users or clients in the IM Data Hub, Audit trail: a mechanism that detects whether there was an attempt, unexpected, or any unauthorized activity has taken place. In this section, we discuss the authentication mechanisms and where to find the audit trail. 5.2.1 Authentication Mechanisms The IM Data Hub supports two types of authentication: Basic Authentication: a mechanism that allows users to login or send their credentials over an HTTP web server, OAuth 2: a mechanism that allows third party clients or apps to connect on behalf of a user via reusable tokens. Oauth2 access is based on the IM Data Hub user roles. We’ll discuss user roles in the Access model section. 5.2.1.1 Basic Authentication Users can login IM Data Hub by specifying their username and password on the login page. Technically, the username is appended with a colon and the password is encoded and then sent over to the server. IM Data Hub also provides two factor authentication mechanisms which allows the users to receive a 2FA code for confirmation at the time of login. The two factor authentication is enabled on the user settings app. You can read more about the 2FA mechanism here: https://www.google.com/landing/2step/ 5.2.1.2 OAuth 2 Authentication Third-party apps can connect to IM Data Hub via tokens provided by the OAuth 2 authentication mechanism. The IM Data Hub does not support the fine-grained OAuth 2 roles, but rather it provides access based on the user roles. Setting up OAuth 2 authentication requires access to the IM Data Hub Web API. You can find the specification about this in the developer’s guide. 5.3 Access Model Access Model defines what and how objects are shared or accessed in the IM Data Hub. Objects, in this case, refers to the data, metadata, and all the components in the IM Data Hub. There are two ways of manage and set up the access model: User roles: Setting roles and the access level for the objects in the IM Data Hub, User groups: Defining groups for sharing access to objects in the IM Data Hub. 5.3.1 User roles User roles defines the level of access to different objects in the IM Data Hub. You can set and assign roles to different objects in from the user app. The following are the most relevant user roles in the IM Data Hub: Name Details _Admin - Category Option Group (Private) and Group Set (Private) Management Administration of private Category options group and Group set _Admin - Country User Management Administration of new users and user groups _Admin - Data Elements (Private) Administration of DEs, DE Groups and Group sets _Admin - Data Set management (Private) Administration of private data sets _Admin - Import / Export MetaData Import and export of metadata and data _Admin - Import/Export aggregate data Import and export of aggregated data _Admin - Org Unit admin advanced Edit OU levels _Admin - Org Units (Basic) Create, edit, and delete OUs _Admin - User Management advanced Replicate and disable users _Admin - Programs (Private) Add and update programs _Analytics - Services (all) Full access to all of DHIS2 analytical tools _App - Browser cache cleaner Clear DHIS2 browser cache _User - Data Entry Aggregated Data entry for data sets (Data Entry, Data Capture for DHIS2) _User - Data Entry Tracker Data entry for programs (Event capture, DHIS2 Android Capture) 5.3.2 User Groups There are two main types of user groups. Country User group - consists of [country ISO code] - Admin and [country ISO code] - Users Global User group - consists of IM - Admin and IM - Users All metadata are shared accordingly to the level of access each user group should have. The Admin User groups can edit and view metadata; capture and view data. The Users User groups can only view metadata; capture and/or view data based on user’s user roles. CORE Cat options are shared publicly with access to view the metadata; and publicly with access to capture and view data. IM - Admin can edit and view the metadata; and capture and view data. [country ISO code] Cat options are shared publicly with access to view metadata; and publicly with access to capture and view data. [country ISO code] Admin can edit and view metadata; and capture and view data. IM - Admin can edit and view the metadata; and capture and view data. CORE Categories and CORE Cat combos are shared publicly with access to view metadata. IM - Admin can edit and view the metadata. [country ISO code] Categories, Cat combos, DEs, DE Groups, Indicators, Indicator Groups, OU Groups and OU Group sets are shared to the country specific user groups. [country ISO code] - Admin can edit and view metadata, while [country ISO code] - Users can only view the metadata. IM DEs, DE Groups, Indicators, Indicator Groups and OU Group sets are shared to the global groups. IM - Admin can edit and view metadata, while IM - Users can view metadata. [country ISO code] Data sets are shared to the country user groups. [country ISO code] - Admin can edit and view the metadata; and capture and view data. [country ISO code] - Users can view metadata; and capture and view data. IM Data sets are shared to the global user groups. IM - Admin can edit and view metadata; and capture and view data. IM - Users can view metadata; and capture and view data. 5.3.3 User Management Correct user management is critical to ensure that the IM Data Hub users have the right access to the right information based on their level of rights. All metadata are shared accordingly to the level of access each user group should have. The Admin User groups can edit and view metadata; capture and view data. The Users User groups can only view metadata; capture and/or view data based on user’s user roles. If a user has [Admin] rights to the IM Data Hub: - Add the user to the relevant [country ISO code] - Admin group - Give the user the relevant User roles to admin users, OUs, DEs, Data sets, etc, like: Admin - Data Elements (Private) - to manage DEs Admin - Data Set management (Private) - to manage Data sets Admin - Country User Management - to admin users Admin - Org Units (Basic) - to admin OUs Analytics - Services (all) - to view analytics tables App - Browser cache cleaner - to clean the cache User - Data Entry Aggregated - to do data entry for Data sets If a user has [Data entry] rights to the IM Data Hub: - Add the user to the relevant [country ISO code] - Users group - Give the user the relevant User roles to conduct data entry, like: User - Data Entry Aggregated - to do data entry for Data set App - Browser cache cleaner - to clean the cache If a user has [Analytics] rights to the IM Data Hub: - Add the user to the relevant [country ISO code] - Users group - Give the user the relevant User roles to view analytics tables, like: Analytics - Services (all) - to view analytics tables App - Browser cache cleaner - to clean the cache 5.4 Important Best Practices for the Access Model If a user is an Admin, you want to assign the user to the [country ISO code] - Admin group. If a user does Data entry or Analytics, you want to assign the user to the [country ISO code] - Users group. 5.4.1 Access from country to global level access: In case you want a country user to have access to global metadata and/or data, [do not] share global metadata with the country User group the user is part of (ie do not share the Data set IM Case Reporting with GH – Admin), but rather include the user in one of the IM User groups (ie include Amos into IM – Users User group in case you want to give him access to data reported at global level). 5.4.2 Access from global to country level access: In case you want a global user to have access to country metadata and/or data, [do not] share country metadata with the IM User group the user is part of (ie do not share the Data set GH Case Reporting with IM – Admin), but rather include the user into one of the relevant [country ISO code] User groups (ie include Keith into the DC – Users User group if you want to give him access to data from DRC).
