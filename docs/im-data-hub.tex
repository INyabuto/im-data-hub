\href{imdatahub.org}{\textbf{IM Data Hub}} is a warehouse for Impact Malaria indicator data. It houses all the IM indicator data for project monitoring and use. It is primarily designed with data users in mind, and so it comes with several tools specifically designed to enable monitoring and promote the use of IM data.

Today, IM Data Hub is extensively used in 11 countries in Africa, and it collects a tremendous amount of data in the following tracks;

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  case management
\item
  Malaria in Pregnancy
\item
  Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention
\item
  Global Technical Leadership.
\end{enumerate}

It is used by multiple partners at different levels, from donors (PMI), Implementers (PSI, Jhpiego, UCSF, e.t.c), and government ministries of health in tracking country performance.

IM Data Hub is implemented in an ST-3 plan since Nov 27th, 2018, and it supports HNQIS (1.4) compatibility.

This guide provides information and the technical specifications you need to know about Impact Malaria (IM) Data Hub. It's an all-inclusive guide and it complements other materials on the development, testing, or training in the Data Hub.

\chapter{Understanding IM Data Hub (\#comp)}\label{understanding-im-data-hub-comp}}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Now that you're already started and you've got some essential background about IM Data Hub, we are going to explore the details/components that form IM Data Hub.

As we saw in chapter \ref{intro}, IM Data Hub is not just a database; it's a project monitoring system. It's divided into components; whose primary goal is to monitor IM indicator data for action.

We'll dive deeper into the components and understand how they are set up in the Hub.

Understanding IM Data Hub components will allow you to report, analyse, and monitor IM indicators more effectively.

I'll start by showing the you reporting component, IM Data Hub uses data sets to collect indicator data. We will discuss them briefly in the next section. We will then walk through the data mining piece, and how the different outputs are pulled together on a dashboard for the project use. We'll wind up by exploring the data quality component and how the IM indicator data pass through the quality checks.

\hypertarget{reporting-component}{%
\section{Reporting Component}\label{reporting-component}}

Reporting is organized through the use of data sets. A data set is simply a list of data elements that are grouped for data collection. We'll talk more about data elements in the next chapter.

A data set has a reporting period and an organization unit. The reporting period specifies how the data is reported, i.e., monthly, or quarterly, while the organization unit determines the location ``where'' the information is collected.

IM Data Hub has two main types of data sets;

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Global data sets for reporting IM indicators. You will learn more about this in section \ref{global-dataset}
\item
  Country specific data set for reporting PMP indicators. You will learn more about this in section \ref{country-dataset}
\end{enumerate}

The data sets are accessible through the data entry app (Fig. \ref{fig:data-entry-app}), and they appear as forms. They are designed to mimic the paper forms to allow ease of data entry/reporting process.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=3.28in]{./images/data-entry-app} \caption{An icon of the data entry app}\label{fig:data-entry-app}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{global-dataset}{%
\subsection{Global datasets}\label{global-dataset}}

Global datasets are accessible at a global level and are used to report IM indicators on a monthly and quarterly basis.

They consist of five data sets, which all begin with the \texttt{{[}project\ code{]}} followed by the \texttt{{[}data\ set\ name{]}} as shown below in yellow (Fig \ref{fig:im-datasets})

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=13.47in]{./images/im datasets} \caption{Global datasets}\label{fig:im-datasets}
\end{figure}

Global datasets are divided into sections (in grey) that groups IM data elements into multiple subheadings for ease of data collection.

There are five main sections:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Diagnosis
\item
  Treatment
\item
  MIP
\item
  Technical leadership
\item
  Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention
\end{enumerate}

We will talk about them in chapter \ref{meta}.

\end{figure}

Before completing the records, please notice the \texttt{Run\ validation} button at the top right. We will talk about this in section 6.

The complete button submits the records into the data hub.

\hypertarget{country-dataset}{%
\subsection{Country Specific Datasets}\label{country-dataset}}

Country specific datasets are mainly used to report country's performance management plan (PMP) indicators. They are accessible at the district or facility level and are reported monthly.

Similar to the global data sets, Country specific ones are organized in sections (in grey) with multiple subheadings. Fig \ref{fig:pmp-datasets}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=18.6in]{./images/pmp datasets} \caption{Country Specific Datasets}\label{fig:pmp-datasets}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{accessing-country-specific-datasets}{%
\subsubsection{Accessing Country Specific Datasets}\label{accessing-country-specific-datasets}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Follow the same steps in section \ref{access-global-datasets} to launch the data entry app. Ensure you are loogied in with your country demo account.
\item
  Click on the level to report (i.e country / district / facility) on the left bar
\item
  Select \texttt{{[}Country\ ISO{]}\ Case\ Reporting} data set and the period to report; this case October 2019.
\item
  Wait for the form to load. Congratulations!
\end{enumerate}

For some countries like \texttt{Kenya}, \texttt{Ghana} and \texttt{Mali} the reporting process is automated through scripts. This is discussed in section.

\hypertarget{data-mining-component}{%
\section{Data Mining Component}\label{data-mining-component}}

Once the data is collected or loaded into the Data Hub, it then becomes available for data mining. Data mining is a technical process that involves the extraction and analysis of data to generate information.

The data mining component provides tools for enabling the extraction and analysis of IM indicator data.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Pivot Tables - extracts data in a tabular format and enables the ability to pivot IM indicators.
\item
  Data Visualizers - generates a variety of charts; standard line, bar charts, pie charts e.t.c
\item
  Maps - gives the ability to visualize IM data on a map.
\end{enumerate}

We will discuss more of these tools in section \ref{pivot}, section \ref{visualizer} and section \ref{map}

\hypertarget{pivot}{%
\subsection{Pivot Tables}\label{pivot}}

If you are familiar with excel, you are probably aware of ``pivoting'' the ability to summarize data on table in multiple dimensions. Excel Pivot Tables inspire Pivot Table.

Pivot Table offers quick access to IM data in a tabular format. It allows the ability to `pivot' data in several dimensions, such as indicators, data elements, periods, and organization units. The aspects can quickly appear as rows or columns, depending on the tailored view.

In the following subsection, we are going to access and tabulate a sample of IM indicator data using the Pivot Table.

As an example, we tabulate and pivot \texttt{IM\ Confirmed\ vs.\ Suspected\ Malaria\ Cases.} for last 12 months at the global level (world)

Please refresh your browser or login with the demo account below if you have not.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\chapter{Impact Malaria Data Specification}\label{data}}

\hypertarget{introduction-1}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

IM data is specified through the use indicators. Indicators consist of a numerator, denominator, and a count. The numerator and denominator are data elements, and the count specifies the applied operation. Counts can be a percentage, a number, or a ratio.

In this chapter, we are going to explore the IM indicators and how they are constructed in the Data Hub.

We'll start by a short introduction to data elements and how they form the base/source of the IM indicators. We'll then explore the different counts and wind up by showing you all the IM indicators.

\hypertarget{meta}{%
\chapter{Metadata Specification}\label{meta}}

\hypertarget{introduction-2}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-2}}

In the previous chapters, we learned about the IM \& PMP indicators and how they are stored and constructed in the Data Hub. That is essential knowledge for you to start monitoring IM indicator data from the source to how they are presented in the IM Data Hub.

In this chapter, we'll dive deep to the bottom and explore what lies underneath beneath the IM Data Hub, the metadata. Metadata is data about data. Interesting?

Let's get started!
